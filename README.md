# UTR_business_case
We have the food delivery service and here we are going to find some potential for improving the performance of our couriers / riders. The goal is to provide the data-driven approach for increasing our current rider utilisation rate (UTR), i.e. how many orders could be delivered by rider per one hour.

Key conclusions and visualization are described separately in .pdf format.
